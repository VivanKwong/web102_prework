## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
A challenge I encountered while building the app was using the ternary operator in Challenge 6. My confusion
was cleared up by doing more research and looking at different code examples. Another challenge I encountered
was during Challenge 3. I completed the tasks but noticed my site did not look like the image on the
Challenge 4 page. I reached out for help on Slack and Luiz Mendez helped me adjust my code for the innerHTML
to fix the issue. 
For my optional features, I ran into challenges with implementing my navigation buttons. I had never linked
a button to something on the same page, so I had to look up how to do that. Also, the header/title banner would block the top of the screen; my solution to this was setting the button to an element just above what 
I wanted the button to link to.
